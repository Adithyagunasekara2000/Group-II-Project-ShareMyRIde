<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Most people commute daily, mostly alone in their vehicles. This increases the level of traffic congestion and fuel consumption, 
and in turn, pollution in the environment. The cost associated with commuting can also become a heavy burden for the majority. 
Although there exists public transportation, it may not be useful or accessible to all, hence there seems to be the need for a solution 
to make commuting more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly.ShareMyRide connects drivers with available seats in their vehicles to passengers traveling the same route. This application aims to optimize travel resources, reduce transportation costs, and promote eco-friendly commuting.</p>
